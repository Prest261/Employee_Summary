# Employee_Summary
## Description
This is a software engineering team generator command line application. This application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This application also has tests built in so the user can make sure the application passes all the tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application generates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

## Usage
This application is meant to be used to help put together a team quickly and efficently and be able to display the data in an organized way.
